#+title: Invoicing.el - Development Notes

* Scope
  The goal of this project is to enable convenient generation of correct US and EU VAT invoices from Org Mode Agenda time tracking data.
  Software should support invoicing both domestic and foreign customers, handling bilingual invoices and currency conversions for VAT.
  Should support accounting for all appropriate taxes, either through built-in code or user extensions. Should allow users to disable
  LaTeX generation part, and substitute it with custom code.

  Extended scope: /Might/ support invoices for goods/services billed in units other than time (hours). /Should/ support sending invoice
  data to third-party software / service, e.g. for people using SaaS tools for managing invoices. /Might/ support pulling in customer
  data from such tools. /Probably will/ support other ways of generating line items than Org Mode Agenda tags.

  Non-goals: Will not force any particular time tracking workflow beyond (in primary basic scope) tagging appropriate headlines.
  Will not, by itself, handle managing invoices - this will be left for users to plug in via hooks in appropriate places.

* Remarks

* Todo List / Roadmap
  Ongoing list of things left to be done.

** TODO Structural

*** TODO Separate code into multiple files                            :alpha:

*** TODO Ensure correct dependency declarations                       :alpha:

*** TODO Ensure correct comment headers in all files                  :alpha:

*** TODO Ensure correct autoloads                                     :alpha:

** TODO User-facing configuration

*** TODO [#A] Determine subtasks                                      :alpha:

** TODO Precalculation

*** TODO Correctly selecting whether or not VAT columns should be included :alpha:
    Which is, possibly, always? But configurable.

*** TODO Correctly adding remarks                                     :alpha:
    - [ ] reverse charge
    - [ ] ... are there any others?

*** TODO Correctly determining whether currency conversion for VAT is necessary :alpha:

*** TODO Fetching correct currency conversion rate                     :beta:
    - [ ] Configurable infrastructure for using remote APIs, probably keyed by seller home currency
    - [ ] Hooking up to at least one such service by default (might not be included in final release)

*** TODO Handling more complex time blocks                            :alpha:
    - [ ] Handling org-mode keyworded time blocks (e.g. =thismonth=, =lastmonth=)
    - [ ] Handling blocks defined as "last N days", "last N weeks"
    - [ ] Handling blocks defined by explicit dates

** TODO Line items table

*** TODO Correct currency tags included in column titles              :alpha:

*** TODO Correct TBLFMs for line items and total                      :alpha:
    - [ ] Line items
    - [ ] Total

*** TODO Tax subtotals                                                 :beta:
    - [ ] Line items
    - [ ] TBLFMs automatically computing correct values

*** TODO Optimized, single-pass computation                            :beta:
    Current implementation does multiple passes over a single file.

*** TODO Progress indicator                                            :beta:
    This operation may take some time with large files and lots of tags, especially in its unoptimized form.

** TODO Reference clocktable
   I.e. one to review headlines contributing to time. Essentially passthrough to org clocktable.
   Need to automatically pull correct time block (possibly from #+CONSTANTS: declaration?)

*** DONE Actual implementation (copy/paste)                           :alpha:
    CLOSED: [2019-03-06 Wed 22:09]

*** TODO Progress indicator                                            :beta:
    This operation might take noticeable time with lots of files.

** TODO Metadata table

*** TODO Collecting data for the table                                :alpha:

**** TODO Block synchronized to adjustments in org mode file          :alpha:

**** TODO Number to Text generation                                   :alpha:
     Might require or even include =spell-number.el= for most languages, but for Polish we need our own solution.
     Needs to pull the total from line items table.

*** TODO Translations                                                 :alpha:
    Might show up. Not 100% sure yet.

*** TODO Printing the table                                           :alpha:

** TODO Generating PDF invoice

*** TODO Pulling back the line items table                            :alpha:

*** TODO Reading back the metadata table                              :alpha:

*** TODO Proper escaping and entity conversions on export             :alpha:
    Maaaybe we could piggyback on Org's LaTeX exporter here?
    We definitely want to handle stuff like 15th -> \nth{15} though.

** TODO Example LaTeX templates                                        :beta:

** TODO Post-processing

*** TODO Moving generated invoice PDF to configured location          :alpha:

** TODO Documentation

*** TODO Everything that can have a docstring has a correct docstring :alpha:

*** TODO Everything in defcustom is thoroughly documented             :alpha:

*** TODO Comment blocks have full documentation                       :alpha:
    Including a full package synopsis and use documentation in the main file.

*** TODO Info page                                                     :beta:

*** TODO Some kind of automation for syncing README.org, Info page and code comments :beta:

** TODO Testing

*** TODO Testing collecting line items across multiple Agenda files   :alpha:

*** TODO Testing for TBLFMs generating correct sums                   :alpha:

*** TODO Testing for appropriate taxation columns being inferred and added, based on line item data :alpha:

*** TODO Testing correct generation of invoice numbers                :alpha:

*** TODO Testing correct resolving of time blocks                     :alpha:

** Other ideas for consideration

*** Defining multiple tags contributing to same invoice line number
    This could cut down on proliferation of line item entries in config, and would allow to easier
    "refactor" what contributes to line items without having to retag tasks in file.
